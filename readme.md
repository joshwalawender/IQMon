Version 2.x IQMon uses the Keck Data Reduction Framework (KDRPF; https://keckdrpframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It also includes (incomplete) scripts to monitor ASCOM and ASCOM Alpaca devices to periodically query their status.

Finally, it includes a flask app to display weather and image quality results.
